After finding new members, he sets out for the middle school tournament, where he crosses paths with a formidable school with the "King of the Upper Court," Tobio Kageyama. Although his team lost, Hinata is still determined to aim for the top and exact revenge on Kageyama. Upon entering high school, he receives the biggest surprise: He and Kageyama are in the same high school volleyball club!

### Plot


Junior high school student, Shoyo Hinata, becomes obsessed with volleyball after catching a glimpse of Karasuno High School playing in Nationals on TV. Of short stature himself, Hinata is inspired by a player the commentators nickname 'The Little Giant', Karasuno's short but talented wing spiker. Though inexperienced, Hinata is athletic and has an impressive vertical jump. He joins his school's volleyball club – only to find he is its sole member, forcing him to spend the next two years trying to convince other students to help him practice.

In the third and final year of junior high, some of Hinata's friends agree to join the club so he can compete in a tournament. In his first official game ever, they suffer a crushing defeat to the team favored to win the tournament – that included third-year Tobio Kageyama, a prodigy setter nicknamed 'The King of the Court' for both his skill and his brutal play style. The two spark a short rivalry, and after the game, Hinata vows to defeat Kageyama in high school.

Hinata studies and is accepted to Karasuno, the same high school the "Little Giant" played for, but is shocked to discover that Kageyama has also chosen to attend Karasuno.[4] Karasuno is revealed to have lost its reputation as a powerhouse school following the era of the Little Giant, often being referred to as 'The Wingless Crows' by other local teams.[5] However, by combining Kageyama's genius setting skills with Hinata's remarkable athleticism, the duo create an explosive new volleyball tactic and develop an unexpected but powerful setter-spiker partnership.

Along the way, Hinata and Kageyama push each other into reaching their full potential, and Hinata develops relationships with his first real team, thus beginning Karasuno's journey of redemption to restore their reputation and make it to the Nationals.

Both Hinata and Kageyama aspire to be professional volleyball players, and make a promise to one another after they graduate from high school that no matter what, they will both play on the same court again. They have a remarkable bond and devote their lives to each other and the sport of volleyball.

## Upcoming Haikyū!! Movies

### 1st Movie: Haikyū!! the Movie: The Battle at the Garbage Dump

***Release Date***

Haikyū!! the Movie: The Battle at the Garbage Dump will release in Japan on February 16, 2024. A western release date hasn’t yet been revealed, though looking at previous big names from the world of anime – such as The Boy and the Heron, Demon Slayer: Mugen Train, and The First Slam Dunk – does suggest that other markets and regions will have to wait around six-to-eight months for it to hit their shores.

There is also a second movie planned which will bring the story to a close. At this rate, anything before 2025 would be a pipe dream. Production I.G. remain on animating duties, while Susumu Mitsunaka will direct.

***Manga chapters that will be adapted***

Haikyu the Movie continues where the fourth season left off. Karasuno has progressed to the third round of the Nationals, besting Tsubakihara in the first round before sneaking past the uber-tough Inarizaki High School and their talismans, the Miya Brothers.

Next up? Nekoma, the high school that has battled it out with Karasuno during their glory years. On top of that, there’s also a friend rivalry brewing between Hinata and the timid setter Kenma.

In terms of the source material, Haikyu: the Movie: Battle at the Garbage Dump will start from chapter 291 of the manga and should go up to chapter 325, give or take a few chapters. That does mean, then, that either a large chunk of the Nationals arc (up to chapter 369) or the Final Arc (chapters 370-402) would be cut out in the second movie. In our opinion, the National Arc wrap-up will likely serve – pun intended – as the series finale for the show, with remnants of the Final Arc scattered in.

For a recap on Nekoma’s journey to their showdown with Karasuno, be sure to check out the season 4 episodes “Vivid” and “Cats vs. Monkeys.” To familiarize yourself with their team, the OVAs The Path of the Ball and Land vs. Air are must-watch specials.

***Movie Cast***

The main cast are all likely to return for Haikyu the Movie. That includes the ultimate underdog Hinata (Ayumu Marase), setter Kageyama (Kaito Ishikawa), and Daichi (Satoshi Hino). Libero Nishinoya (Nobuhiko Okamoto) will bring the thunder once more as, too, will hot-headed Tanaka (Yu Hayashi).

Joining them is Tsukushima (Koki Uchiyama), Sugawara (Miyu Irino), Asahi (Yoshimasa Hosoya), and Yamaguchi (Soma Saito), among others. Watching on from the wings are Hitoka Yachi (Sumire Morohoshi) and Kiyoko Shimizu (Kaori Nazuka).

On the Nekoma side, we’ll hear plenty more from the likes of Kenma (Yuki Kaji), Tetsuro Kuroo (Yuichi Nakamura), and Lev (Mark Ishii).
